# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior on an e-commerce platform to create targeted marketing strategies. Using segmentation techniques, including RFM analysis and clustering algorithms, the study identifies distinct customer groups and provides actionable recommendations to improve retention, satisfaction, and revenue.

## Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Understand customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and payment preferences.
- **Segmentation Analysis**:
  - Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
  - Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide marketing recommendations tailored to each customer segment.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Data Processing**:
  - Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Data normalization (MinMaxScaler), logarithmic transformations
- **Clustering Methods**:
  - K-Means clustering: Optimal clusters using distortion and silhouette scores.
  - DBSCAN: Density-based clustering for complex structures.
  - Hierarchical clustering: Dendrogram visualization.
- **Visualization**:
  - T-SNE plots for cluster representation.
  - Heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots for insights.

## Key Insights
- **RFM Segments**:
  - VIP Customers: High recency, frequency, and spending.
  - At-Risk Customers: Low recency and frequency, requiring retention efforts.
  - Potential Customers: High recency, low frequency, targeted for conversion.
- **Clustering Results**:
  - Cluster 0: Satisfied customers – focus on loyalty programs.
  - Cluster 1: High spenders but dissatisfied – address feedback issues.
  - Cluster 4: Inactive and unhappy customers – reactivation campaigns needed.
- **Geographic Trends**:
  - São Paulo (42% of customers) dominates the customer base.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - Data exploration and cleaning
  - Segmentation analysis using multiple clustering algorithms
- **Presentation**:
  - Summarizes findings and provides actionable marketing strategies.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Customer distributions by state, category preferences, and payment trends.
